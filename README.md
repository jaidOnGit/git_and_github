# Git Commands Guide

A step-by-step guide to using Git effectively in your projects.

---

## 1. Initialize a Repository

Start version control in a new project:

```bash
git init
```
This initializes a new Git repository in your project directory.

---

## 2. Clone a Repository

To work on an existing project, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Example:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
```

---

## 3. Check Repository Status

View the current state of your working directory and staged changes:

```bash
git status
```

---

## 4. Stage Changes

Add specific files to the staging area:

```bash
git add <file-name>
```

To add all changes in the current directory:
```bash
git add .
```

---

## 5. Commit Changes

Save changes to the repository with a meaningful message:

```bash
git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
```

---

## 6. View Logs

View the commit history:

```bash
git log
```

For a concise commit history:
```bash
git log --oneline
```

---

## 7. Create a Branch

Create a new branch:

```bash
git branch <branch-name>
```

Switch to the new branch:
```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

Create and switch in one step:
```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

---

## 8. Merge Branches

Merge another branch into your current branch:

```bash
git merge <branch-name>
```

---

## 9. Push Changes

Push your branch to a remote repository:

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

---

## 10. Pull Changes

Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository:

```bash
git pull origin <branch-name>
```

---

## 11. Undo Changes

- **Unstage a file:**
  ```bash
  git reset <file-name>
  ```

- **Discard local changes:**
  ```bash
  git checkout -- <file-name>
  ```

---

## 12. Work with Remote Repositories

- **Add a remote repository:**
  ```bash
  git remote add origin <repository-url>
  ```

- **View remote repositories:**
  ```bash
  git remote -v
  ```

- **Delete a remote branch:**
  ```bash
  git push origin --delete <branch-name>
  ```

---

## 13. Handle Stashes

- **Stash uncommitted changes:**
  ```bash
  git stash
  ```

- **Apply stashed changes:**
  ```bash
  git stash apply
  ```

---

## 14. Advanced Commands
